# React_Portfolio_Erin_Mulcahey

## Description

My motivation for creating this application was to create a place where I can share my projects with potential jobs and other developers. I created this portfolio using React skills to help learn the latest technologies. Creating this application solves the problem of not having multiple projects all in one place. This site showcases how I used react to create an application that fulfills this need. I learned how to use React and how to push my application to Netlify to make it a live.
